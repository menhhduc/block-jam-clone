     * 1. Create a grid, choose a starting point and endpoints
     * 2. Write a function to scan neighbor nodes (just scan)
     * 3. Implement the algorithm to find short possible path to move from starting point to endpoints (
     * => recommend using recursion
     * 4. Print out the set of points or nodes to present the path. (or calculate the distance)
     * 5. Random select the node that marked as NON-WALKABLE to make them re-calculate the path.
     * 6. Draw the gizmos to test => done.
